# BSS-ArcadeCabinet 1.0!
UI and sqlite management for the cabinet, with my game for a sample

Cabinet Code last updated June, 2023
To test it out, you'll need:
  - Processing 4
  - A JRE or JDK version 17 or older
  - If you're NOT using Mac, download SQLITE (can be done through cmd line)
  - If you're NOT using Windows, you'll have to re-do pathways if you want to access the game through the main UI.
      > Note: You can still access the game normally, and simply imagine that it works.

Note that the following keys will correspond to these actual keys:
  Up, Left, Down, Right, Z, X
  W A S D F G 

I'll try to explain further when I'm back.
